to be fair, i also have to give credit to the game of DegerGames, [Super Flags! Flag Quiz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.retro.quizza&hl=en&gl=US). I got much inspiration from that app. However, i was not satisfied with the design of the game, displaying of statistics, missing haptic feedback for bezel interfaces, as well as the amount of ads. No way was i going to pay to remove those! That app seemed rushed, as to just publish as many games as possible. But what have we learned? Quality > Quantity. Because the game was still fun, i decided to be inspired by the game and made my version, GeoQuiz. Now it is the end of the day and im glad i am done before the next day. And trust me. It took me more time to prepare the PlayStore release then the coding itself! I hope you enjoy it though.
